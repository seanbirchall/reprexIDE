### Welcome to the REPREX IDE 
Reprex is a minimal RStudio like IDE that runs serverless in the browser, locally on a desktop, or remotely in the cloud! Reprex is the Cloud IDE for data science, analytics, engineering.... everything data.

Sharing R code, Packages, Apps, APIs, SQL, and even JS is as simple as clicking the share button in the header. You can also quickly deploy your code to the cloud after signing up with a few clicks from the deploy button.

Want to test this out for your own projects or business just clone me @ https://github.com/seanbirchall/reprexIDE

The goal with Reprex is to create an open-source product with comparable features to Posit Connect. While also providing more optimized hosting options to better fit the needs of an individuals first project on a budget, or a businesses high tech debt.

Want to share a Shiny app on the internet?
  - click the share link
  - or deploy it as a serverless app on www.reprex.org
  - for more sophisticated apps maybe you want to deploy it on a container or ec2... just click deploy
  
Want to deploy a plumber api that can scale to meet any needs?
 - deploy it as a serverless lambda function 
 - don't need 
 
Want to schedule some code?

Want to lock down features for specific users?
  - just follow along with our OAuth integration 
  
Why am I making this?

I scrape data from governments and large mega-corps. I spent a year trying to gain traction with a data business believing R wasn't a viable option to share data with the world.
Reprex is just a first layer platform to a number of other data products I plan to launch.
